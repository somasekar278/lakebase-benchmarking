Lakebase Benchmarking Framework

A production-ready framework for benchmarking Lakebase performance and cost 
against other databases (DynamoDB, Aurora, Cosmos DB) for real-time feature 
store workloads.

Key Features:
- Multi-backend benchmarking with fair comparisons
- Cost tracking and TCO analysis
- Bulk loading (10-100x faster than JDBC)
- UNLOGGED tables option (additional 2-3x speedup)
- Flexible schema generation for any workload
- Comprehensive CLI tool (run_benchmark.py)
- Databricks notebooks for data loading and benchmarking
- Terraform deployment (Infrastructure as Code)

Performance:
- Bulk COPY: 10-30x faster than JDBC for large tables
- UNLOGGED mode: 96x faster than JDBC for 100M+ rows
- Cost-efficient: Lakebase is 132x cheaper than DynamoDB for benchmarks

Documentation:
- README.md - Complete overview and quick start
- CLI_GUIDE.md - Command-line reference
- BACKEND_DESIGN.md - Multi-backend architecture
- BULK_LOAD_GUIDE.md - High-performance data loading
- docs/SETUP.md - Detailed setup instructions
- docs/BINPACKING_STRATEGY.md - Query optimization
